It's called `get_victim_machines`. This function accepts an argument which limits how many machines the Monkey should find.\n\nWe want to make that value editable by the user instead of constant in the code.\n\n## Manual testing\n\n1. After you've performed the required changes, reload the Server and check your value exists in the Internal tab of the config (see image).\n\n2. Set the new value to 1, and run Monkey locally (from source). See that the Monkey only scans one machine."
