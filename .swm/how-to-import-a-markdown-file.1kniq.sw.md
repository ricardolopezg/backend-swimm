# An h1 header

Paragraphs are separated by a blank line.

2nd paragraph. _Italic_, **bold**, and `monospace`. Itemized lists look like:

*   this one
    
*   that one
    
*   the other one
    

Note that --- not considering the asterisk --- the actual text content starts at 4-columns in.

> Block quotes are written like so.
> 
> They can span multiple paragraphs, if you like.

Use 3 dashes for an em-dash. Use 2 dashes for ranges (ex., "it's all in chapters 12--14"). Three dots ... will be converted to an ellipsis. Unicode is supported. â˜º

## An h2 header

<br/>

<br/>

`victims_max_find`<swm-token data-swm-token=":monkey/infection_monkey/config.py:135:1:1:`    victims_max_find = 100`"/> is important to consider.
<!-- NOTE-swimm-snippet: the lines below link your snippet to Swimm -->
### ðŸ“„ monkey/infection_monkey/config.py
```python
137        # how many victims to exploit before stopping
138        victims_max_exploit = 100
```

<br/>

Here's a numbered list:

1.  first item
    
2.  second item
    
3.  third item
    

Note again how the actual text starts at 4 columns in (4 characters from the left side). Here's a code sample:

```
# Let me re-iterate ...
for i in 1 .. 10 { do-something(i) }
```

As you probably guessed, indented 4 spaces. By the way, instead of indenting the block, you can use delimited blocks, if you like:

```
define foobar() {
    print "Welcome to flavor country!";
}
```

(which makes copying & pasting easier). You can optionally mark the delimited block for Pandoc to syntax highlight it:

```
import time
# Quick, count to ten!
for i in range(10):
    # (but not *too* quick)
    time.sleep(0.5)
    print(i)
```

### An h3 header

Now a nested list:

1.  First, get these ingredients:
    
    *   carrots
        
    *   celery
        
    *   lentils
        
2.  Boil some water.
    
3.  Dump everything in the pot and follow this algorithm:
    
    ```
    find wooden spoon
    uncover pot
    stir
    cover pot
    balance wooden spoon precariously on pot handle
    wait 10 minutes
    goto first step (or shut off burner when done)
    ```
    
    Do not bump wooden spoon or it will fall.
    

Notice again how text always lines up on 4-space indents (including that last line which continues item 3 above).

Here's a link to [a website](http://foo.bar).

\[^1\]: Some footnote text.

Tables can look like this:

Name Size Material Color

All Business 9 leather brown Roundabout 10 hemp canvas natural Cinderella 11 glass transparent

Table: Shoes sizes, materials, and colors.

(The above is the caption for the table.) Pandoc also supports multi-line tables:

Keyword Text

red Sunsets, apples, and other red or reddish things.

green Leaves, grass, frogs and other things it's not easy being.

A horizontal rule follows.

Here's a definition list:

apples : Good for making applesauce.

oranges : Citrus!

tomatoes : There's no "e" in tomatoe.

Again, text is indented 4 spaces. (Put a blank line between each term and its definition to spread things out more.)

Here's a "line block" (note how whitespace is honored):

| Line one | Line too | Line tree

and images can be specified like so:

<br/>

<br/>

<div align="center"><img src="https://ecdn.teacherspayteachers.com/thumbitem/Examples-of-Big-and-Small-5033763-1573983223/original-5033763-1.jpg" style="width:'50%'"/></div>

<br/>

<br/>

Inline math equation: $\\omega = d\\phi / dt$. Display math should get its own line like so:

$$I = \\int \\rho R^{2} dV$$

And note that you can backslash-escape any punctuation characters which you wish to be displayed literally, ex.: \`foo\`, \*bar\*, etc.
