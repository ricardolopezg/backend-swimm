In order to make sure that the new `ScheduleJobs` PBA is shown in the configuration on the Monkey Island, you need to add its details to the configuration file(s). <br><br>

Since this particular PBA is related to the MITRE techniques [T1168](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1168) and [T1053](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1053), make sure to link the PBA with these techniques in the configuration as well. <br><br>

Each part of the configuration has an important role  
- *enum* â€” contains the relevant PBA's class name(s)
- *title* â€” holds the name of the PBA which is displayed in the configuration on the Monkey Island
- *info* â€” consists of an elaboration on the PBA's working which is displayed in the configuration on the Monkey Island
- *attack_techniques* â€” has the IDs of the MITRE techniques associated with the PBA

## Manual test  
Once you think you're done...
- Run the Monkey Island
- You should be able to see your new PBA under the "Monkey" tab in the configuration, along with its information when you click on it
- Further, when you enable/disable the associated MITRE techniques under the ATT&CK tab in the configuration, the PBA should also be enabled/disabled

- The PBA details in this file are reflected on the Monkey Island in the PBA configuration.
- PBAs are also linked to the relevant MITRE techniques in this file, whose results can then be seen in the MITRE ATT&CK report on the Monkey Island.
