<br/>

The name of your new PBA (which creates scheduled jobs on the machine) will be used in a few places, including the report. <br><br>
You should briefly define what your PBA does in a constant variable, such that it can be used by both the Monkey and the Monkey Island.

## Manual test  
Once you think you're done...
- Run the Monkey Island
- Make sure the "Job scheduling" PBA is enabled in the "Monkey" tab in the configuration — for this test, disable network scanning, exploiting, and all other PBAs
- Run the Monkey
- Check the PBA section in the Security report for the name you gave to the new PBA

- The name defined here for your PBA can be seen on the Monkey Island in the PBA section in the Security report.
- The results of each PBA stored in the telemetry are also identified by the string defined here for that PBA.
