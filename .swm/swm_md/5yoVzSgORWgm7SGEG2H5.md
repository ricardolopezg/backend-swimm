1.  Under **Basics**:
    
    1.  Choose a name for your Infection Monkey instance, such as InfectionMonkey.
        
    2.  Choose a username and password or provide a SSH public key for authentication.
        
    3.  Choose a resource group and the location your instance will be deployed in.
        
2.  Under **Size**

3.  Under **Settings**
    
    1.  Choose the network the new instance will be a member of.
        
    2.  In the **Network Security Group** field, make sure ports 5000 and 5001 on the machine are accessible for inbound TCP traffic.
        
4.  Under **Summary**

At this point, Azure will instance and deploy your new machine. When ready, you can browse to the Infection Monkey running on your fresh deployment at:

Upgrading
---------

Currently there's no "upgrade-in-place" option when a new version comes out. To get the new version, you can deploy a new machine from the marketplace. If you'd like to keep your existing configuration, you can export it to a file by using the Export button and then import it to the new Monkey Island.
