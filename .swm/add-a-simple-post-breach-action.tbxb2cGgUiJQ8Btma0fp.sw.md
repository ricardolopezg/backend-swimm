Read [our documentation about adding a new PBA](https://www.guardicore.com/infectionmonkey/docs/development/adding-post-breach-actions/).

After that we want you to add the BackdoorUser PBA. The commands that add users for Win and Linux can be retrieved from `get_commands_to_add_user` - make sure you see how to use this function correctly.

Note that the PBA should impact the T1136 MITRE technique as well!

# Manual test to confirm

1.  Run the Monkey Island
    
2.  Make sure your new PBA is enabled by default in the config - for this test, disable network scanning, exploiting, and all other PBAs
    
3.  Run Monkey
    
4.  See the PBA in the security report 5, See the PBA in the MITRE report in the relevant technique

Take a look at the configuration of the island again - see the "command to run after breach" option we offer the user? It's implemented exactly like you did right now but each user can do it for themselves.

However, what if the PBA needs to do stuff which is more complex than just running a few commands? In that case...
