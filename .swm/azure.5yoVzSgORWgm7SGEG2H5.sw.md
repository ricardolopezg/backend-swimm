    2.  In the **Network Security Group** field, make sure ports 5000 and 5001 on the machine are accessible for inbound TCP traffic.

Upgrading
---------

Currently there's no "upgrade-in-place" option when a new version comes out. To get the new version, you can deploy a new machine from the marketplace. If you'd like to keep your existing configuration, you can export it to a file by using the Export button and then import it to the new Monkey Island.
